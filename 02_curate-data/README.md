# Obtaining QM data

The scripts here download and curate QM data for fitting the valence parameters of the force field. These are completely copied from the [Sage 2.2.0 fitting procedure](https://github.com/openforcefield/sage-2.2.0).

This repo adds some additional scripts and notebooks to examine the training data, but otherwise the training data is *not modified* from the Sage 2.2.0 fitting process.
