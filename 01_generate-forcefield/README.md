# Force field generation

This directory contains the script for generating the template of the initial force field.  

Example usage:

```bash
conda activate fb_196_ic_0318

python generate-forcefield.py                                   \
    --force-field-name  "openff_unconstrained-2.1.0.offxml"     \
    --output            "output/initial-force-field_nor4.offxml"

```

Where `--force-field-name` specifies which force field to base this one on, and `--output` is the name of the new force field. Changes to the parameters of the `--force-field-name` will be generated by the python script. The values for the bond and angle parameters are placeholders and will be overridden in Step 3, while the values of the initial values of the torsions will be kept.

As a modification from Sage 2.2.0, known linear angle patterns were manually modified to be set to 180 degrees (where they were not in Sage 2.1.0). This step shouldn't be necessary in the future if starting from 2.2.0.
